Git Commands
*****************************
1- configuration global name

git config --global user.name "Masood"

2- configuration global email.

git config -- global user.email "mbabri331@gmail.com"

note: so before commiting the above two statements I used my git bash window to go to C:/Selenium "folder" where I have added these two commands.

Now we can create a new project by going to that Selenium folder and create a git project.

3- Initialize the project by the following command

git init gitProject

which is going to create git repository in that folder

4- Then we check the status of the git project

git status

its going to show the the git status on branch master

5- Now we can use git add . command to add files

git add .   (it will add all the files in the git hub)
git add . How to use git.txt (will add files individually)

Now if we run git status command again it will show the file in green. 

if you would like to delete any file from these files 

git rm --cached test.txt  (will remove the file from the directory)

6- Now we need to commit the git 

git commit -m "initial commit"

and then you can check by 

git log

@@ Now I have created two more files in the same folder and going to check the status 

$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   How to use git.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        gitPractice.txt
        gitPractice2.txt

so it show the first file is changed and it shows at the end that I have added two more files in that folder.
