Git Commands
*****************************
1- configuration global name

git config --global user.name "Masood"

2- configuration global email.

git config -- global user.email "mbabri331@gmail.com"

note: so before commiting the above two statements I used my git bash window to go to C:/Selenium "folder" where I have added these two commands.

Now we can create a new project by going to that Selenium folder and create a git project.

3- Initialize the project by the following command

git init gitProject

which is going to create git repository in that folder

4- Then we check the status of the git project

git status

its going to show the the git status on branch master

5- Now we can use git add . command to add files

git add .   (it will add all the files in the git hub)
git add . How to use git.txt (will add files individually)

Now if we run git status command again it will show the file in green. 

if you would like to delete any file from these files 

git rm --cached test.txt  (will remove the file from the directory)

6- Now we need to commit the git 

git commit -m "initial commit"

and then you can check by 

git log
